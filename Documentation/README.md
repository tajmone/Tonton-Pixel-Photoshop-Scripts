### Notes

>   **[Mariani’s] Note**: The HTML version of the documents should usually be
>   preferred over the PDF version, since it provides more information through
>   the use of tooltips: for instance, while hovering over a CharID, the
>   equivalent StringID appears automatically, and vice versa.

 

>   **tajmone’s Note 1**: I’ve also added MarkDown versions of the HTML
>   documents, created by me. But I had to readapt some tables which contained
>   mutli row/col spans—I’ve opted to split them over more rows, at the cost of
>   having duplicates, rather then insert an HTML version of the table in a
>   MarkDown document.
