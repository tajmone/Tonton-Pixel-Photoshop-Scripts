# Tonton Pixel Photoshop Scripts

A collection of scripts and documents for Photoshop scripting in JavaScript (and
JSON), written/created by Michel MARIANI and originally published on **Tonton
Pixel’s Blog** ([www.tonton-pixel.com](<http://www.tonton-pixel.com>)) under the
GNU General Public License (GPL) v3.

Mariani has documented in detail the specifications of many of Photoshop saved
files formats (actions, custom shapes, gradients, and styles files) and written
an impressive JS/JSON library to parse and manipulate them.

Unfortunately, **Tonton Pixel’s Blog** has been unreachable for a long time, and
the only way I’ve been able to visit the website (and retrive material) is via
[WaybackMachine](<https://web.archive.org/web/20150906140236/http://www.tonton-pixel.com/blog/>)—also,
the only means of contacting the author was a contact-form, which is
unreachable.

Since this precious GPL lincensed material doesn’t appear anywhere else on the
web, I thought of “salvaging” it by sharing it here on GitHub. It will most
definitely provide a good source of inspiration for anyone wishing to write some
Photoshop-related software, especially the well written “unofficial”
documentation on PS files specs—which, to my knowledge, is not to be found
elsewhere.

## Contents Description

The repository contains all the original—and unaltered—zip archives found on
**Tonton Pixel’s** website download section, along with the material downloaded
from its “documentation” section.

All materials are copyrighted © 2011-2014 by Michel MARIANI, all script files
are open-source, and licensed by MARIANI under the GNU General Public License
(GPL) v3.

Central to the scripts, are two projects:

1.  JSON Action Manager

2.  JSON Action Toolbox

### JSON Action Manager

In Mariani’s words:

>   “JSON Action Manager” is an open-source scripting library for Adobe
>   Photoshop, written in JavaScript, and licensed using GPLv3. It allows
>   developers to interact with the underlying Action Manager using a simpler
>   JSON AM Data Format (please refer also to the JSON Project Introduction page
>   to get more information).

>   What is called “JSON Action Manager” is basically a set of interrelated
>   modules defining global variables acting as namespaces…

### JSON Action Toolbox

>   “JSON Action Toolbox” is a developer-oriented set of automation plug-ins for
>   Adobe Photoshop running on Mac OS X, and is distributed as Freeware. It is
>   basically a combination of a “JSON Event Listener” and “JSON Property
>   Getter” modules, with several improvements over the original sample versions
>   coming with the SDK…

All the scripts are organized in a folders structure mirroring the original
grouping by Mariani. Each zip-archived library comes with a rich (JSDoc
generated) API documentation in HTML format, and with example/test scripts.

Especially, I advise to further read the articles linked below (which I didn’t
include in this repo since it wasn’t clear if they were too under GPL license,
and I haven’t yet managed to contact the author):
